# Decision making with Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.
people = {'Jane': {'willingness to travel':
                  'desire for new experience':
                  'cost':
                  'indian food':
                  'mexican food':
                  'hipster points':
                  'vegitarian':
                  }

          }

# Transform the user data into a matrix(M_people). Keep track of column and row ids.



# Next you collected data from an internet website. You got the following information.

resturants  = {'flacos':{'distance' :
                        'novelty' :
                        'cost':
                        'average rating':
                        'cuisine':
                        'vegitarians'
                        }

}


# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column index.

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.

# 1. Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.

# 2. Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.

# 3. Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent?

# 4. Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entryâ€™s represent?

# 5. Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal resturant choice.

# 6. Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?

# 7. How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.

# 8. Find  user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# 9. Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.

# 10. Should you split in two groups today?

# 11. Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?

# 12. Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their weight matrix?
