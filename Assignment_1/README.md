__Assignment__ = "Assignment 1"


Objective: Write python code / functions that take a list or dictionary of 
Classifiers and hyper-parameters, i.e. logistic regression, etc.., each with 
three (3) different sets of hyper-parameters, with varying values of each
hyper-parameter and perform analysis for all combinations (?)Classifier X 
(3) hyper-parameters X (?)hyper-parameter values.
Find a simple classification data set and generate.  Fit models to data set,
using k-fold cross validation, and record classifier/hyper-parameter combination,
and model performance criteria results.
Generate graphical represenations (matplotlib/seaborn) that will assist in
identifying the optimal clf/hyper parameter settings.
The code should run from terminal and save the results to the directory that
the program is executed from.
Output format: Graphics -> .png
               Data     -> .json
